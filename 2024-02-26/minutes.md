## Intro & overview of agenda

(Brian) Welcome, let's wait for everyone to join in.
As a reminder, please use the Zoom chat or raise your hand to ask any questions.

- We have a position open for an [Open Source Community Manager](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/careers/position/gh/5675010/). It is an exciting role. Please share with your networks.
- There's a new post on the MDN Blog [about technical writing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/technical-writing/) by Dipika.
- Ruth is organizing a content workshop for sometime in March, where we'll assess the Learn area and related docs. This exercise will also be important after the introduction of the MDN Curriculum.

## Team updates

### MDN Curriculum launch (@chrisdavidmills and @couci)

Chris:

- The MDN Curriculum is ready for launch tomorrow, February 27th.
- For those who haven't heard, it will serve as a canonical blueprint to base courses on, a roadmap for learners, and a guide to design certifications.
- (Sharing screen to show a pre-launch preview) A walthrough of the three modules: Getting started, Core, and Extensions.

Konstantina:

- Anuja has done a fabulous job with the design work for the MDN Curriculum.
- The MDN Curriculum is launching tomorrow and there'll be a blog post from Hermina as well.
- Let us know if you have any questions when you start using the MDN Curriculum.
- The blog post will link to the curriculum repository where folks will be able to give feedback.

Question from Brian: Is there any guidance or expectation on how much time a learner would take when proceeding from one module to the next?
Chris: We had considered this aspect but timing ideas are vague and very subjective. The circumstances and backgrounds of learners are pretty varied. We decided not to include any time guidance for now but based on feedback, we could consider it in the future.

## Contributing to MDN (@bsmth)

- Most of the folks in this call are already aware but for the benefit of those new to the project, I'd like to provide a brief overview of how you can contribute to MDN, where to look for docs, and how to chat with us or ask for help.
