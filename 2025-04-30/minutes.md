# Minutes from MDN community meeting - 30th April, 2025

Host: Pranshu

Pranshu: Welcome to the April community call! For those who are here for the workshop and want it to be recorded. I would like to let you know that the workshop will be recorded so you can come back and view the [video](https://youtu.be/WLJiNbfnPPs?si=YfPrAEUuNFq3shdP) to follow the workshop.

Let's move over to the call.

## (Pranshu) Changes to the Course Partner links

Pranshu: We are updating some links within the Learn area and adding some course partner links. Nothing changes in there specifically, just adding more light to links to Scrimba and ensuring that you know if the link is a course partner link or not.

Pranshu: This is not a huge change, but we wanted to let everyone know of what's coming and how we are changing stuff which you would notice while learning on MDN.

Pranshu: We are open for feedback on Discord, GitHub Discussions, and let us know what you think.

## (Pranshu) Mozilla Festival 2025 CFP is live

Pranshu: [Mozilla Festival](https://www.mozillafestival.org/), if you don't know, is a place where passionate individuals unite to build a better internet. Whether you create art, code, program or scroll in support of a safer internet—you’re in the right place. A lot of cool stuff happens there.

Pranshu: As someone who has faciliated, volunteered and wrangled at the Mozilla Festival, I highly recommend attending the conference. Or, better yet, the CFP is open, so you can [apply to speak](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/proposals/) at the Mozilla Festival 2025.

Pranshu: It's happening from 7-9 November in Barcelona, and I'm attending! Even if you're speaking, thinking of speaking, or attending, come meet me. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know on [Discord](https://mdn.dev/discord).

If you would like to follow the workshop happened ahead, you can checkout the [video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/WLJiNbfnPPs?si=YfPrAEUuNFq3shdP).

Pranshu: Thank you, everyone! See you next month!
