## Questions/Discussions

Questions from folks & anything to discuss

- [How to use inline status macros?](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/654) (@onkarruikar)
  Need to conclude the discussion/vote so that the synchronization automation can continue.
  - Should secure context and status macros have the same strategy? At the moment we've decided on a [diffrent strategy for secure context macros](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/482#discussioncomment-7825014). It hasn't been implemented in entire content so there is still time to change it to match the status macro strategy.
- [Indicators & banners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aNnhhLuCMlG0G5r3p42eAyuy4JWJfT41S2a4XnqznA4/edit): Synchronous discussion (is there a discussion on https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/).
- [Writing guidelines and Glossary sections are living on islands](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/661). These sections need some visiblity to be recognized.
