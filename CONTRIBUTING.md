# Contribution guide

Thanks for your interest in taking part in MDN community meetings.
This document provides some tips for getting your topics added to the agenda and discussed during calls.

## Adding to the agenda

There are folders for each community call in the format `YY-MM-DD`.
If you want to add something to the agenda, you can open a pull request that suggests to add your item to a future call:

```plain
├── 24-01-22
│   ├── agenda.md  <-- Add your topic to `agenda.md`  (e.g., January 22nd 2024)
│   └── minutes.md
...
```

You can open a pull request on GitHub by navigating to the `YY-MM-dd/agenda.md` document, and clicking the edit icon.
For more information, see the [GitHub documentation for editing files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).

Make sure you use the following format when you're adding your topic:

```markdown
- Discuss my awesome topic. See [link for more details](https://github.com/mdn/community-meetings/pulls) (@MyUsername)
```

Your pull request should have links to other information in the description field, if necessary.
There are hints in the pull request template that will help guide you on your submission!
