## Questions/Discussions

Questions from folks & anything to discuss

- [How to use inline status macros?](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/654) (@onkarruikar)
  Need to conlude the discussion/vote so that the synchronization automation can continue.
  - Should secure context and status macros have the same strategy? At the moment we've decided on a [diffrent strategy for secure context macros](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/482#discussioncomment-7825014). It hasn't been implemented in entire content so there is still time to change it to match the status macro strategy.
